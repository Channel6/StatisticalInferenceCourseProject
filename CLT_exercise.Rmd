## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the exponential distribution and compare it to the Central Limit Theorem. For this analysis, set ``lambda`` equal to ``0.2`` for all simulations. The investigation will compare the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials over 1000 simulations.
